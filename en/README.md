# 🖥️ Computer Science Roadmap

Hello! 👋 My name is Vitor. I am self-taught and truly passionate about technology.

This repository is my "logbook" on the journey through the fundamentals of Computer Science. Here, I document my progress, daily challenges, and my evolution in seeking to master how computers really work, from the bit to complex systems.

*Roadmap based on: [**Computer Science Roadmap**](../en/00-Resources/computer-science.pdf)*

## ⚡ Daily Challenges (Off-Roadmap)
Beyond theoretical study, I complete one practical exercise per day to strengthen my logic.

# 🚀 My C Programming Study Portfolio

Welcome to my C language learning repository! This project organizes my evolution from basic logic to data structures and complex simulations. Each folder is structured to demonstrate the specific skills I have been developing.

## 📂 Repository Organization

### [01-fundamentals](./01-Fundamentals(Exercises))
**What you will find here:**
The foundation of my journey. Exercises demonstrating mastery of the language's essential syntax.
* **Skills:** Variable manipulation (`int`, `float`), data input/output (`scanf`/`printf`), arithmetic operators, and conditional structures (`if`, `else if`, `else`).
* **Highlight:** Parity verification and proportionality calculation exercises.

### [02-functions](./02-Functions(Exercises))
**What you will find here:**
The transition from sequential code to modular programming.
* **Skills:** Creating custom functions, parameter passing, return values, and the Single Responsibility Principle.
* **Highlight:** Functions encapsulating comparison logic and sign verification.

### [03-arrays-and-strings](./03-Arrays-And-Strings(Exercises))
**What you will find here:**
Data collection management and memory handling.
* **Skills:** One-dimensional arrays (numeric arrays), matrices (string arrays), loops (`for`), extreme value searching (min/max), and statistical calculations applied to lists.
* **Highlight:** Full number analyzer and the name registration system using character matrices.

### [04-simulations](./04-Simulations(Exercises))
**What you will find here:**
Applications utilizing system resources and non-deterministic logic.
* **Skills:** System libraries (`time.h`, `stdlib.h`), pseudo-random number generation (`rand`, `srand`), and real-time event simulation.
* **Highlight:** Randomness tests and scoreboard simulators.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools
* **Language:** C (C99/C11 Standards)
* **Environment:** Linux (Ubuntu)
* **Compiler:** GCC
* **Versioning:** Git

## 📈 Personal Evolution
This repository is constantly updated as I advance toward topics like **Pointers**, **Dynamic Allocation**, and **Advanced Data Structures**. The goal is to demonstrate a solid foundation for low-level development and performance-oriented systems.
